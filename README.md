# Predicting-Quality-of-Wine-using-LinearRegression

### Prerequisites

The things that you must have a decent knowledge on: 
```
    * Python
    * Linear Algebra
    * Calculus
```

### Installation

* This project is fully based on python. So, the necessary modules needed for computaion are:
```
    * Numpy
    * Sklearn
    * Matplotlib
    * Pandas
```
* The commands needed for installing the above modules on windows platfom are:
```python

    pip install numpy
    pip install sklearn
    pip install matplotlib
 
```
* we can verify the installation of modules by  importing the modules. For example:
```python

    import numpy
    import pandas
    from sklearn.decomposition import kernelPCA 
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
```
### About Model

* There are total of 11 input featues which predicts the value of output feature.
* This model ranks the quality of the wine which ranks between 0-9.
